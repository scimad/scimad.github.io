Sure, looking back again at Javascript when 32 comes with some deep existential questions, career questions and what not! Well, "Take as much retries as you need to". Here's some Javascript for ya:

## The Nullish coalescing operator `??`
Quite simply, `a ?? b` is:
* if `a` is defined, then `a`
* if `a` isn't defined, then `b`

{% highlight js %}
result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;
{% endhighlight %}
