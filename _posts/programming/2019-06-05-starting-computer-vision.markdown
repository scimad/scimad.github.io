There's a problem in engineering drawing where we have to traceback the orthographic views (or plans) of a drawing made in perspective view. As a first problem of computer vision, I just (right now) decided that I want to find the edges of such 3d drawing so that I could later get a 3d model and then traceback any orthographic view.
