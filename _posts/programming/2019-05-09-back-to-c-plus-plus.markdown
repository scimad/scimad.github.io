When I wrote [my first C++ project][buddhichal] (Buddhichal / Chess, 2015), I thought I had understood OOP. I thought, I had understood the notion of objects and classes. I had, a little. But only when my friend Prakash gave it a look, I knew how primitive (C-like) it was in sense of actually using OOP features and design principles. Objects were not segregrated in terms of thier responsibilites. I realized that the dependencies of methods were not clear (in my mind and in the program henceforth). Many `static` elements were used. Part of the problem was also because I have used `OpenGL` {which is a C(Not C++ / OOP)-library} to render graphics for project.

So, when my code was reviewed, Prakash got disappointed. I got more disappointed. To the extent that I never *really* looked back to C++ with full enthusiasm. The most painful thing about that all is I really didn't study and use C++ Templates and carried a guilt of not doing C++ really well for all these years.

Now as part of an office project in computer vision, I am having to use [OpenCV][opencv] (C++). And of course, giant liabries like opencv high level of abstraction and for that, C++ templates are a must. So, I am learning C++ templates and diving into the details of OpenCV (C++).

In this post, I want to share my learning and experiences with C++ templates.

# C++ Templates
C++ templates are meant to create parameterized familities of related functions or classes. This important because as a programmer, we often come up with situations where implementing multiple versions of similar functions and classes are necessary. Consider a stack. A stack needs to be able to add (push) elements to it or pop elements from it. The same is true no matter if the stack is made up of integer or a string or a matrix to store image, or a vector to store a word embedding.

C++ provides the flexibility using *function template* and *class template*. The template are not codes that are actually compiled but the machine code for template function and template class are generated at the time of instantiation. 

A template function is instatiated when it is invoked for the first time. The compiler doesn't know prior to the inovcation what kind of data the function should expect. This is different from function overriding in the sense that the actual codes for overrided functions (based on different number of parameters or parameter types) are actually written and compiled beforehand. However, in case of function templates, only the template definition is known beforehand.

A class template can provide a generic definition that can be used to represent various types of object skeleton. The exact class is generated at the time of instantiation based on the template definition.

### Templates in the Standard Library

Actually the C++ standard library contains numerious class template definitions and different classes are created by instantiation of those classes. For example the classes `string`, `istream`, `ostream`, `iostream` and so on are instantiations for the `char` type. There are also different search and sort algorithms in the algorithm library in the standard C++ library which are implemented as global function templates and can be used for any set of objects.

C++ code snippets to define **class template for a *stack***:

{% highlight c++ %}
{% include attachments/stack.h%}
{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, the following code shows how to define function templates. As always is the case in the definition of template, it is prefixed by `template`.

{% highlight c++ %}

template<class T>
void exchange (T& x, T& y){
    T help = x;
    x = y;
    y = help;

}

{% endhighlight %}

Following is a completely working C++ code that defines a function template and uses it for two different classes, namely, string and integer.

{% highlight c++ %}
{% include attachments/template-basic.cpp%}
{% endhighlight %}

**Output:**

{% highlight html %}
before exchange:
a=madhav and b=universe
After exchange:
a=universe and b=madhav

before exchange:
x=321 and y=222
After exchange:
x=222 and y=321
{% endhighlight %}

***This blogpost is not yet a complete one. I will write more about my C++ programming experience in other posts.***
