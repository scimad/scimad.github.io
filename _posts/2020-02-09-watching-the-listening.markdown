# Today

I was seated, they said something and I listened to it. It was a beautiful scene to watch and a beautiful happening. I know for sure that it was a beautiful scene to watch and someone was enjoying the scene. Someone that felt like me but was completely different from whom they were referring all that words to. That words came direct to my ears, my nerves my mind and I don't know where it went but it didn't remain attached there. I watched it come and I watched it go. It had rarely been like that. Someone watched it come and watched it go. A glue that used to tie what they said to whom they said didn't exist for the moment.

No doubt I heard it, and no doubt I understood it. In fact, I understood it better and clearer than ever before as the listening happenned without any rejection. For the moment, there was hardly anything I was fearing of. And in fact, there was a very big distance between whom they were referring to and who actually was listening to. The listener had seen the vast space that separated the two. I knew I was listening, I knew they were talking to me, I knew they were referring that to me, but still I was not referred. A shadow self of me, a ghost self, a past was being referred. An assumption was being referred to. They were talking to someone whom they identified as me. They didn't notice the arrow did hit their target but that target wasn't me. I instead was watching the dead self of mine being hit by the arrow. I didn't lend my consciousness to that past self, and hence there was no pain to hear that, nor guilt or anger. That spontaneous moment is single handedly enough to prove or at least remind we aren't our past. We are a new born baby every moment.
